## Inspiration

The covid era taught us that getting a meal, once a day was one of the biggest challenges which a lot of needy people faced. Many **RationShop** owners would store the stock in a large amount which is provided by Government to distribute to the needy ones, but they sell them for higher price, which makes the needy ones suffer. We, as responsible citizens of the nation, wanted to dismantle this situation and help the needy.

## Working

We intend to provide transparency in the supply-chain of food using Blockchain. The supply would be tracked from the origin till it reaches the end user using Identifiers packed with bags which will be added to the blockchain at each stage of network. Thus, alteration of the records will be impossible. The state government would generate the identifiers which will be further carried to the the district authorities and the ration shops and also the quantities of foods are tracked to verify the distribution between RationShops and Consumers. Thus the verification of goods will be ensured at every checkpoint which ensures that no frauds or corruption take place.

## Building it
- First, we deployed a **Smart Contract** which keeps track of all the users and transactions happenings in the network.
- We used **web3.js** to communicate with the smart contract.
- We fetched the data by capturing the events when transactions happens in the network.
- Lastly, we used ReactJS and fetched data to build the front end of the network.


## Tech Stacks

- Solidity
- React JS
- Truffle
- Ethereum
- MetaMask


## Challenges
- Integrating Blockchain with the frontend while adding and fetching data.
- Grouping the data to **verify the transactions** that are occuring at each stage of the network.

## Learnings and Achievements
- This was the first time we tried to integrate Blockchain code written in solidity along with React JS which turned out to be a great learning experience.
- The 36 hour long hackathon always inspired us at every moment to keep our calm and overcome the bugs which hindered our way.

## Future Plans

- Fetching the Aadhar Card information and linking a crypto account with it to make the transactions through it.
- Implementing this app not just for food grains but also generalizing it for many different commodities.
